## About Me 😝


🎓 I am a student from the 2023 cohort at Wuhan University, majoring in Software Engineering.

💻 Currently, I am focused on learning backend development and working on projects to strengthen my skills in this area.

🔍 I'm dedicated to developing a strong foundation in key areas of computer science such as data structures, operating systems, and computer networks, while also diving deep into backend technologies.

🚀 I'm actively working on my own projects, and I'm excited to continue growing and improving them!

📝 You can follow my journey through my blog Vks's Blog (under construction...).
